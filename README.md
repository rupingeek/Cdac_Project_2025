🚀 Predictive Maintenance System | Full-Stack Application

A production-style predictive maintenance system designed to monitor machine usage, predict maintenance requirements, and manage the complete maintenance lifecycle using real-world industrial logic.
This project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development, backend business logic, role-based access control, and data-driven decision making.

🔑 Key Highlights (Recruiter Scan Section)

1.Built a full-stack predictive maintenance application using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL
2.Implemented usage-based maintenance prediction using configurable threshold hours
3.Designed a complete maintenance lifecycle (OK → MAINTENANCE_DUE → COMPLETED → OK)
4.Added role-based access control (Admin / User)
5.Developed RESTful APIs with layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
6.Implemented real-time dashboard visualizations using Chart.js
7.Ensured data integrity with audit-ready maintenance history
8.Optimized backend logic for performance and scalability

🧠 Problem Statement

In industrial environments, machines often fail due to unmonitored usage and delayed maintenance.
This system addresses that problem by tracking machine usage, predicting maintenance needs, and recording maintenance activities to prevent downtime and improve operational efficiency.
