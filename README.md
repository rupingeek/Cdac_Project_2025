🚀 Predictive Maintenance System | Full-Stack Application

A production-style predictive maintenance system designed to monitor machine usage, predict maintenance requirements, and manage the complete maintenance lifecycle using real-world industrial logic.
This project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development, backend business logic, role-based access control, and data-driven decision making.

🔑 Key Highlights

Built a full-stack predictive maintenance application using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL, implementing usage-based maintenance prediction through configurable threshold hours. Designed and implemented a complete maintenance lifecycle (OK → MAINTENANCE_DUE → COMPLETED → OK) with role-based access control for Admin and User roles. Developed RESTful APIs following a layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) and integrated real-time dashboard visualizations using Chart.js. Ensured data integrity and traceability through an audit-ready maintenance history while optimizing backend logic for performance, scalability, and real-world industrial workflows.

🧠 Problem Statement

In industrial environments, machines often fail due to unmonitored usage and delayed maintenance.
This system addresses that problem by tracking machine usage, predicting maintenance needs, and recording maintenance activities to prevent downtime and improve operational efficiency.
